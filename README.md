# FAQ Section with Collapsible Answers

This repository contains the HTML and CSS files for a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section featuring collapsible answers. This interactive component allows users to expand and collapse answers to specific questions, providing a clean and organized way to present information.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an accessible and user-friendly FAQ section for a website. By using a radio button and CSS to control the visibility of the answers, it provides a simple mechanism for users to find the information they need without overwhelming them with text.

## Features

* **Clear Heading:** Features a prominent "Frequently asked questions" heading.
* **Question List:** Presents a list of questions using an unordered list (`<ul>`).
* **Collapsible Answers:** Each question has a corresponding answer that is initially hidden and can be toggled by clicking the question label.
* **Visual Indicator:** Each question label includes a Remix Icon (`ri-arrow-down-s-line`) that visually indicates the expand/collapse functionality.
* **Basic Styling:** Provides a clean and readable layout using CSS.
* **Remix Icons:** Integrates Remix Icons for the down arrow.
* **Radio Button Control:** Uses radio buttons (hidden from view) to manage the state of the expanded/collapsed answers. Only one answer can be open at a time due to the nature of radio buttons within the same `name` attribute.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Remix Icons (via CDN)
